# wumpus_with_fire

This is (unfinished: first version 20230413) code generated through group discussion between five devs and ChatGPT 3.5.  

The explicit goal of the interaction was to implement the classic text game "Hunt the Wumpus" in Python.

The higher-level goal was to begin getting familiar with development patterns that are useful with LLMs - understanding the behavior
of ChatGPT took priority over getting a working implementation.
